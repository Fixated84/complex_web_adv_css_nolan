  <div id="ss_menu" class="animated zoomIn">
	<div class="ss_button">1. The Complimentary Design Consultation</div>
	<div class="ss_content"><p>This is where one of our design professionals comes to your home to assess your needs. We ask questions about your specific lifestyle and home improvement needs. Here, we can provide suggestions and share ideas on how to best move forward with the project.</p></div>
	<div class="ss_button">2. The Feasibility Study</div>
	<div class="ss_content"><p>Here, we research past projects of similar scope, contact vendors, specialty contractors and come up with a guaranteed budget range for your project. This will be within 10%, up or down, of a given figure. This will be used as a basis for the design. We will also isolate design challenges and come up with solutions for your project. Beyond that, we will look into zoning, conservation, historical and building department requirements and assemble information you will need.</p></div>
	<div class="ss_button">3. The Design</div>
	<div class="ss_content"><p>The Design is the most important part of your project. As a matter of fact, it is so important, we dedicated an entire page of this website to this one subject.</p></div>
	<div class="ss_button">4. Construction Contract</div>
	<div class="ss_content"><p>The construction contract gives a hard figure and is the budget for your project. It also includes a project schedule which is backed up by Our Guarantee.</p></div>
	<div class="ss_button">5. Pre-Construction Meeting</div>
	<div class="ss_content"><p>This covers key information you will need as you move through the remodel of your home. Here, we answer questions as to what to expect during a major remodeling project. A successful remodeling project always goes smoothest when everyone is on the same page from the beginning.</p></div>
	<div class="ss_button">6. Substantial Completion Walk-Through</div>
    <div class="ss_content"><p>Once the project is completed, we will walk through with a fine-toothed comb and list all items to be handled on a punch list. Once complete, we execute the punch list and present you a completed project!</p></div>
    <div class="ss_button">7. Post-Construction Wrap-Up</div>
    <div class="ss_content"><p>We let you enjoy your newly remodeled home for a couple of weeks, and then schedule a sit-down meeting at your home. Here, we gather your feedback on how you feel the project was executed from design through construction. We make notes and improve our systems so your next experience with us is even better.</p></div>
