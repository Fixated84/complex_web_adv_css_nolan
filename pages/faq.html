 <h3>AllStyle Homes Frequently Asked Questions</h3>  
    <br>
   
  <div id="ss_menu">
	<div class="ss_button">Q. I want to build a new home. Where do I start?</div>
	<div class="ss_content"><p>You start by arranging a no obligation appointment with your local AllStyle Homes builder. Your builder will be able to direct you with finance, house and land packages, land availability, home design, and price.</p></div>
	<div class="ss_button">Q. Should I consult with my builder before I buy a block of land?</div>
	<div class="ss_content"><p>It is recommended that you discuss your intended land purchase with your builder as they can assist you in finding a suitable block. Keep in mind that if you are independently purchasing a block of land to check the available building envelope (the area within the allotment for construction) as this will vary across estates and heavily affect the type of home that you can build.</p></div>
	<div class="ss_button">Q. Can I make changes to the plan?</div>
	<div class="ss_content"><p>Yes. All AllStyle Homes floor plans are flexible, so you can modify a design to suit you and your family’s requirements. You can do this by visiting your local builder.</p></div>
	<div class="ss_button">Q. I already have a block of land. How can I find out if the design I like will fit the block?</div>
	<div class="ss_content"><p>If you have purchased your block of land and it is located on a new land estate, you will have received documents pertaining to the Design Guidelines and other stipulations governing the building requirements on that estate. Arrange an appointment with your AllStyles Homes builder and bring all the relevant documents to the meeting. Following the meeting, your builder will then visit and appraise your land, checking the width of the home frontage and any setback requirements (the distance between your home and the site boundaries). If you have a sloping block your builder can determine whether your chosen design will work with the block or if any extra excavation or drainage costs will be required.</p></div>
	<div class="ss_button">Q. Do you build on sloping sites?</div>
	<div class="ss_content"><p>Yes. We even have floor plans designed specifically for sloping blocks. If you find a design you like that is not specifically created for a sloping block, your Allstyles Homes builder may be able to modify it to suit your land requirements.</p></div>
	<div class="ss_button">Q. Can I access my home throughout the building process?</div>
    <div class="ss_content"><p>Only if you make arrangements with your builder to meet them on site and this can be done safely. Due to occupational health and safety requirements, you will not be able to access the site throughout the construction phase of your new home unsupervised.</p></div>
    <div class="ss_button">Q. Do you use reputable, well known brands?</div>
    <div class="ss_content"><p>AllStyles Homes builders use nationally recognised companies as their preferred supplier partners. All products are installed correctly and are in line with the relevant Australian standards and Building codes.</p></div>
        <div class="ss_button">Q. What type of warranty will I receive with my home?</div>
    <div class="ss_content"><p>In most states your builder is required to take out a warranty insurance policy before commencing the construction of your new home. While your home is under construction, it is covered by a different policy that expires once you move in. The warranty cover varies from state to state – check with local authorities for the period relevant to your area.</p></div>
     <div class="ss_button">Q. How does the maintenance process work?</div>
    <div class="ss_content"><p>When you move into your home your builder will give you a maintenance form which you are required to complete and return within three to six months of handover (depending on your state). This allows you to report any general maintenance issues to your builder, which will be completed within a reasonable time frame after the allocated maintenance period has expired.</p></div>
